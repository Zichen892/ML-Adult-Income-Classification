# ML-Adult-Income-Classification

**1. Problem Statement**: 

In today’s world, understanding the factors that influence income can help us identify ways to improve economic opportunities and reduce income inequality. In this project, we will be analyzing the Adult Income dataset to predict whether an individual earns over $50,000 per year or not, based on their demographic and employment information.
To achieve this classification task, we will be using five different machine learning algorithms: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, KNN, tree_based models, and Neural Network. Each Algorithm has its own strengths and weaknesses, and by applying multiple algorithms, we can compare their performances and select the best model for this specific problem.
Our dataset contains various features such as age, education level, occupation, marital status, and more, which can all be used to predict an individual’s income level. By training our models on the data and evaluating their precision, recall and F1 score, we can determine which algorithm performs the best on this task and gain insights into the key factors that influence income.
